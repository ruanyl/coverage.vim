# Coverage.vim

Greatly inspired by [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter)

A vim plugin which shows code coverage like [wallabyjs](https://wallabyjs.com/). Supports istanbul `json reporter` format:
- [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)
- [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)
- [karma-coverage](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage)
- [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

> requires vim8 or neovim

### Install

```
Plug 'ruanyl/coverage.vim'
```

### How it works

This plugin uses vim8 new feature `timer_start()` to read the `<coverage-*>.json` in an interval. Whenver the file changed, it will update the signs of current buffer.

The plugin awares of signs from other plugins, for example: `syntastic`, `ale` ... But it will overwrite the signs of `gitgutter`.

### Config

Specify the path to `coverage.json` file relative to your current working directory.

```
let g:coverage_json_report_path = 'coverage/coverage.json'
```

Or if you have multiple files (from backend and frontend for example).

Entries are summed up (but conflicts can emerge if the same files are analyzed)

```
let g:coverage_json_report_pathes = ['coverage/coverage-final.json', 'coverage/Firefox YZ/coverage-final.json']
```

Define the symbol display for covered lines

```
let g:coverage_sign_covered = 'â¦¿'
```

Define the interval time of updating the coverage lines

```
let g:coverage_interval = 5000
```

Do not display signs on covered lines

```
let g:coverage_show_covered = 0
```

Display signs on uncovered lines

```
let g:coverage_show_uncovered = 1
```

To set the base path from which coverage\_json\_report\_path[es] are resolved
```
let g:coverage_json_project_path = '/my/absolute/path'
```
